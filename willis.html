									<p>I interviewed Mr. Willis, a Priory parent who built a Mountain Dulcimer in
										December of 2016. Here is a paraphrased transcript of our conversation.<br></p>
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
										<li>Can you describe when you first began woodworking? Who exposed you to it?
											<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
												<li>I started woodworking when I was young. There was never specific day
													when picked it up, I just always remember doing it. My father was a
													woodworker, even more so than I am. He had a woodshop and got me
													into woodworking.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Great. And what kinds of things did you build?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>So, woodworking has been more of a hobby of mine throughout the years.
												I've always struggled to find enough time for it. Right? I started with
												more handyman type jobs when I was younger, and I have progressed to
												more advanced projects such as my dulcimer in recent years. It has
												really come in handy when something in the house needs fixing.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Where do you woodwork now?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>I have my own set of tools. There's a space dedicated to them in the
												garage. I recently have made more room for tools used to create things
												like instruments because I've grown interested in making them as opposed
												to something like a cabinet for the house.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Have you ever built anything where you tried to interweave your cultural or
											family background into the product?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Not really. As I mentioned earlier, this dulcimer was the first "art"
												piece I've made out of wood, and I haven't really used woodworking to
												express any deeper ideas.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Now lets transition and talk a little bit more about your dulcimer. What
											style did you choose? What are some of its features?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>My dulcimer is an hourglass shape, although I know teardrops are fairly
												popular too. Which type are you building?</li>
										</ul>
										<li>I'm building an hourglass shaped dulcimer as well. I actually have the
											headstock here if you'd like to see it...</li>
										<li>(I proceed to share about my dulcimer. The woods I chose, pictures, etc.)
										</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Anyways, I use walnut all the way around, much like you did, but with
												mahogany on top. However, I built mine from a kit as opposed to your
												approach from scratch. Therefore, it only took about 2 weeks for me to
												finish my dulcimer. </li>
										</ul>
										<li>Wow, two weeks only?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Well, it was two weeks working 8 hours a day (over Christmas break), and
												starting with a kit, I was able to skip the parts like steaming and
												cutting wood. By the time I got it, most of the work was by hand. I
												basically only used a chisel and other hand tools to finish the
												dulcimer.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Excellent. Now, what inspired you to build a dulcimer></li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Now, what's really interesting is that Father Martin is the one who
												sparked my interest. He's built a number of dulcimer, but other wooden
												instruments too, and there was a parent party where he showed a few of
												them off. I saw his dulcimer and decided to build one myself.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Amazing, Father Martin is actually me mentor in this process, and It has
											been a phenomenal experience working with him to build a dulcimer.</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>That's really cool you're able to work with him. Yeah, Noah was building
												a boomerang with Father Martin, or finishing it or something, and Father
												Martin had one of his dulcimers up there. I was able to see it, and play
												it (this was some time after the party), and that experience pushed me
												even more to build a dulcimer.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>I love it. Now, could you tell me which part of the dulcimer you spent the
											most time on?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Yes. The headstock took the longest because I changed it the most from
												what it originally arrived as. It originally was much larger, and I
												shaved off much of it in order to get this the curves I have now.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>How about the hardest step in the process?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Despite the head stock taking the longest, the hardest part was putting
												the instrument all together. When I tried to attach the top and bottom
												to the sides, I had trouble getting a firm seal. I needed multiple
												attempts, but eventually I was able to seal the sides to the front and
												back.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>I can see this is a very beautiful dulcimer. But in hindsight, would you
											have done anything differently?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Other than being more careful when gluing the sides to the end blocks to
												make the attachment of the sides and front easier, I would have hollowed
												out the underside of the fretboard. Sometimes, luthiers choose to choose
												out the fretboard to get a better sound, I didn't, but for the amount of
												time I spent, I wish I had taken that extra step.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Amazing. I love hearing about your experience building a dulcimer. That's
											all of the specific questions I had. Is there anything else you would like
											to share about the build process?</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>Yes. As you approach the finishing of your dulcimer, you will need to
												choose what you would like to coat your instrument with. I used a lacker
												for the body, which gives it this nice shine. However, I used teak oil
												for the fretboard because oils from fingers wear down lacker quickly. So
												you'll need to research and choose what kind of finish you want for your
												dulcimer.</li>
										</ul>
										<li>Ok, thank you for the advice, and thank you for meeting me today, Mr. Willis
										</li>
										<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
											<li>My pleasure!</li>
