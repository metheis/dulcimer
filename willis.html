								<div class="excerpt"><p>I interviewed Mr. Willis, a Priory parent who built a Mountain Dulcimer in December of 2016. Here is a paraphrased transcript of our conversation.<br></p>
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                                        <li>Can you describe when you first began woodworking? Who exposed you to it?
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>I started woodworking when I was young. There was never specific day when picked it up, I just always remember doing it. My father was a woodworker, even more so than I am. He had a wood shop and got me into woodworking.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Great. And what kinds of things did you build?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>So, woodworking has been more of a hobby of mine throughout the years. I've always struggled to find enough time for it. Right? I started with more handyman type jobs when I was younger, and I have progressed to more advanced projects such as my dulcimer in recent years. It has really come in handy when something in the house needs fixing.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Where do you wood work now?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>I have my own set of tools. There's a space dedicated to them in the garage. I recently have made more room for tools used to create things like instruments because I've grown interested in making them as opposed to something like a cabinet for the house.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Have you ever built anything where you tried to interweve your cultural or family background into the product?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Not really. As I mentioned ealeir, this dulcimer was the first "art" piece I've made out of wood, and I haven't really used woodoworking to express any deeper ideas.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Now lets transition and talk a little bit more about your dulcimer. What style did you choose? Qhat are some of its features?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>My dulcimer is an hourglass shape, although I know tear drops are fairly popular too. Which type are you building?</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>I'm building an hourglass shaped dulcimer as well. I actually have the headstock here if you'd like to see it...</li>
                                        <li>(I proceed to share about my dulcimer. The woods I chose, pictures, etc.)</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Anyways, I use walnut all the way around, much like you did, but with mahogony on top. However, I did cuild mine from a kit as opposed to your approach from scratch. Therefore, it only took about 2 weeks for me to finish my dulcimer. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Wow, two weeks only?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Well, it was two weeks working 8 hours a day (over Christmas break), and starting with a kit, I was able to skip the parts like steaming and cutting wood. By the time I got it, most of the work was by hand. I basically only used a chissel and other hand tools to finish the dulcimer.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Excellent. Now, what inspired you to cuild a dulcimer></li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Now, what's really interesting is that Father Martin is the one who sparked my interest. He's built a number of dulcimer, but other wooden instruments too, and there was a parent party where he showed a few of them off. I saw his dulcimer and decided to build one myself.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Amazing, Father Martin is actually me mentor in this proccess, and It has been a phenominal experience working with him to build a dulcimer.</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>That's really cool you're able to work with him. Yea, Noah was buildiung a boomerang with Father Martin, or finishing it or something, and Father Martin had one of his dulcimers up there. I was able to see it, and play it (this was some time after the party), and that experience pushed me even more to build a dulcimer.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>I love it. Now, could you tell me wwhich part of the dulcimer you spent the most time on?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Yes. The headstock took the longest because I changed it the most from what it origianlly arrived as. It origianlly was much larger, and I shaved off much of it in order to get this the curves I have now.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>How about the hardest step in the proccess?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Despite the head stock taking the longest, the hardest part was putting the instrument all together. When I tried to attach the top and bottom to the sides, I had trouble getting a firm seal. I needed multiple attempts, but eventually I was able to seal the sides to the front and back.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>I can see this is a very beautifle dulcimer. But in hindsight, would you have done anything differently?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Other than being more careful when glueing the sides to the end blacks to make the attachment of the sides and front easier, I would have hollowed out the underside of the fretboard. Sometimes, luthiers choose to choose out teh fret board to get a better sound, I didn't, but for the amount of time I spent, I wish I had taken that extra step.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Amazing. I love hearing about your experience building a dulcimer. That's all of the specific questions I had. Is there anything else you would like to share about the build proccess?</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>Yes. As you approach the finishing of your dulcimer, you will need to choose what you would like to coat your instrument with. I used a lacker for the body, which gives it this nice shine. However, I used teak oil for the freatboard because oils from fingers wear down lacker quickly. So you'll need to research and choose what kind of finish you want for your dulcimer.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Ok, thank you for the advice, and thank you for meeting me today, Mr. Willis</li>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                                            <li>My pleasure!</li>
